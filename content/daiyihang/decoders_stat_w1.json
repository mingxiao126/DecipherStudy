    "original_question": "In a competitive midterm exam for STAT 124, the class average score was 72 points with a standard deviation of 8 points. A student named Alex received his result and found his Z-score was $Z = 2.0$. Alex's friend, Jordan, received a Z-score of $Z = -1.59$. Alex claims that since his Z-score is 2.0, he scored exactly 2 points higher than the average. Meanwhile, the professor notes that Jordan's score is considered \"unusual\" because it falls below a certain threshold. Evaluate Alex's claim and explain the meaning of Jordan's score.",
