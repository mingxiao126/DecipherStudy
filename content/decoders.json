They placed a large colorful banner at the main exit that read: 'Passionate about health? Take 2 minutes to rate our drink and receive a free $25 premium yoga mat!' By the end of the day, 450 attendees had participated. The results showed that 98% of respondents loved the taste and would buy it. Based on this, the marketing team concluded that 98% of all Canadians will like the drink. Identify the bias.",
