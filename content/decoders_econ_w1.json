They applied a non-toxic blue fluorescent dye to the side fins of these fish and released them back into the pond. To ensure data accuracy, volunteers also recorded the average pond depth (3.5m) and the temperature (22°C). On Friday, they returned and conducted a second capture at three different observation points, catching a total of 150 koi. Upon inspection, 30 of these fish were found to have the blue fluorescent markings. Estimate the total number of koi in the pond.",
