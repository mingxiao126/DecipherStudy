      "answer": "**Absolute Advantage** is about efficiency (using **fewer inputs** or time)[cite: 78, 79]. **Comparative Advantage** is about trade-offs (having a **lower opportunity cost**)[cite: 82, 83]. Decisions should be based on comparative advantage[cite: 85].",

      "question": "What is **Specialization** and why is it beneficial?",
      "answer": "Specialization is when individuals focus on tasks where they have a **comparative advantage**[cite: 75, 117]. It leads to **Gains from Trade** by reallocating resources to their best uses, making both parties better off[cite: 72, 74].",

      "answer": "The **Knowledge Problem** occurs when central planners cannot know everyone's specific needs[cite: 108, 109]. **Internal Markets** solve this by using market mechanisms (like bidding) to let those with the highest marginal benefit obtain resources[cite: 110, 113].",
