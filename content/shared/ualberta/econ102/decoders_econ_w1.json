    "original_question": "Sarah won a non-transferable ticket to a jazz concert that she values at 80. Alternatively, she could work a shift at a local cafe and earn 50. A third option is attending a friend's birthday dinner, which she values at 60 but costs 20 to attend. While Sarah is deciding, her brother offers her 10 to help him move furniture for an hour, a task she dislikes so much she would pay 15 to avoid it. If Sarah chooses to go to the jazz concert, what is her total economic surplus from this decision?",
