    "question": "What are the three main **Data Collection Methods**?",
    "answer": "1. Sampling/Survey Sampling: Surveying a sample to infer population traits. 2. Design of Experiments: Manipulating factors to establish causation (with randomization/control). 3. Observational Study: Recording data without intervention; shows association/correlation only (confounding may exist).",

  {
    "question": "How do **Experiments** differ from **Observational Studies** regarding causation?",
    "answer": "Only experiments can support causal conclusions because they manipulate explanatory variables and use random assignment/control to reduce confounding. Observational studies do not assign treatments, so they typically support association/correlation only and may be affected by confounding variables.",

  {
    "question": "What is the difference between **Open** and **Closed Questions**?",
    "answer": "Open questions: Respondents answer in their own words; richer detail but harder to code/analyze. Closed questions: Respondents choose from preset options (e.g., multiple choice, rating); easier to analyze but less depth and may constrain responses.",

    "question": "What are **Double-barrelled Questions** and why should they be avoided?",
    "answer": "Double-barrelled questions ask two different things at once (e.g., \"Should we cut taxes and increase services?\"). They should be avoided because respondents may agree with one part but not the other, producing ambiguous and unreliable data.",

  {
    "question": "What is the **Randomized Response** technique used for?",
    "answer": "A privacy-protecting survey technique for sensitive or illegal behaviors. A random mechanism (e.g., coin flip) determines which question is answered, so the interviewer cannot know whether a \"Yes\" refers to the sensitive item, improving honesty while preserving anonymity.",

    "question": "What are the core principles of **Experimental Design**?",

    "answer": "1. Survey Sampling: Drawing a sample from a population to infer characteristics. 2. Design of Experiments: Manipulating one or more factors to evaluate effects on a response variable; supports causal conclusions when random assignment/control is used. 3.
