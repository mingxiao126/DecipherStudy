      "answer": "1. **Sampling/Survey Sampling**: Surveying a sample to infer population traits. 2. **Design of Experiments**: Manipulating factors to prove **Causation**. 3. **Observational Study**: Recording data without interference, showing only **Association/Correlation**.",

      "answer": "Only **Experiments** can prove **Causation** through randomization and control. **Observational Studies** only reveal **Association** because of potential **Confounding Variables**.",

      "answer": "These are questions that ask **two different things** at once (e.g., 'Should we cut taxes and increase services?'). They should be avoided because they confuse respondents and produce unclear data.",
