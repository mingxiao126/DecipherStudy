    "question": "What are the three main **Data Collection Methods**?",
    "answer": "1. Sampling/Survey Sampling: Surveying a sample to infer population traits. 2. Design of Experiments: Manipulating factors to establish causation (with randomization/control). 3. Observational Study: Recording data without intervention; shows association/correlation only (confounding may exist).",

  {
    "question": "How do **Experiments** differ from **Observational Studies** regarding causation?",
    "answer": "Only experiments can support causal conclusions because they manipulate explanatory variables and use random assignment/control to reduce confounding. Observational studies do not assign treatments, so they typically support association/correlation only and may be affected by confounding variables.",

    "answer": "Double-barrelled questions ask two different things at once (e.g., \"Should we cut taxes and increase services?\"). They should be avoided because respondents may agree with one part but not the other, producing ambiguous and unreliable data.",
