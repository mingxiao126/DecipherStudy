      "question": "Differentiate between a **Bar Chart** and a **Histogram**.",
      "answer": "**Bar Charts** are for **categorical** data; bars have spaces between them. **Histograms** are for **continuous numeric** data; bars are adjacent (no spaces) to show density across intervals called **Bins**.",

      "answer": "It consists of: 1. **Minimum**, 2. **Lower Quartile (Q1)**, 3. **Median**, 4. **Upper Quartile (Q3)**, 5. **Maximum**. The box represents the **Interquartile Range (IQR = Q3 - Q1)**.",

      "question": "Why should **Bar Charts** usually start at a **Zero Baseline**?",
      "answer": "Because we perceive both length and area in bars. Starting at zero ensures that the visual ratio matches the data ratio, preventing misleading interpretations.",

      "question": "When is a **Dot Chart** better than a Bar Chart?",

      "question": "How does **Bin Width** affect a Histogram?",
      "answer": "Changing the bin width can change the perceived shape of the distribution. Too many bins create 'noise'; too few bins hide the structure (oversmoothing).",
