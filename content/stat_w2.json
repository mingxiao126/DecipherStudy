      "question": "When should you use a **Stem-and-Leaf Plot** versus a **Dot Plot**?",
      "answer": "**Stem-and-Leaf Plot**: Best for **small datasets** because it preserves original numerical values. **Dot Plot**: Suitable for **small to medium** datasets, showing the density of distribution by stacking dots.",

      "question": "What are the key design rules for a **Bar Chart**?",
      "answer": "1. Used for **Categorical** or discrete data. 2. There should be **gaps** between bars. 3. The vertical axis (Y-axis) must **start from 0** because humans perceive value through length.",

      "question": "How do **Histograms** differ from Bar Charts, and what do they show?",
      "answer": "**Histograms** are for **continuous numeric data** with no gaps between bars (bins). They allow us to identify the **Shape**, **Center**, and **Spread** of a distribution.",
