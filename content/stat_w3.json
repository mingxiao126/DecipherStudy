      "answer": "If you code 'Yes/Success' as **1** and 'No/Failure' as **0**, the average of these 0s and 1s is exactly the proportion ($p$ or $\\hat{p}$).",

      "question": "Compare **Mean** and **Median** regarding **Outliers**.",
      "answer": "The **Mean** is highly sensitive to outliers (a single large value pulls it up). The **Median** is **Resistant (Robust)**, meaning it is not affected by extreme values.",

      "answer": "1. **Symmetric**: Mean $\\approx$ Median. 2. **Right-skewed**: Mean > Median (mean is pulled by the long right tail). 3. **Left-skewed**: Mean < Median.",

      "answer": "**IQR = Q3 - Q1**. It represents the range of the **middle 50%** of the data. Like the median, it is a **Resistant** measure of spread, making it ideal for skewed data or data with outliers.",
